Just a calculator app, made in java.


## Features

- Basic Arithmetic Expressions
- Trig and Inverse Trig functions
- PI
- Exponents and Square Roots
- Logarithms (ln)

Made just for fun, and to learn some data structure concepts as the Stack, Queue, and Linked List.
Also I learned how to make a simple GUI
